# Quick Sort Visualization

Welcome to the Quick Sort Visualization repository! This project includes an informative page explaining the Quick Sort algorithm and an integrative demo to showcase the algorithm's functionality.


## Quick Sort Algorithm

Quick Sort is a widely used sorting algorithm known for its efficiency and speed. It follows the divide-and-conquer approach, recursively dividing the array into smaller sub-arrays, sorting them, and then combining them to achieve the final sorted result.

## Demo

Explore the integrative demo to visualize how Quick Sort operates on an array. The demo provides a step-by-step representation of the algorithm's sorting process.
